/**
 * @def VL6180x_HAVE_DMAX_RANGING
 * @brief Enable DMax calculation for ranging applications.
 *  
 * When set to 1, __Dmax__ is returned by API typically when  @a VL6180x_RangePollMeasurement() high level
 * function is called (this is returned in @a VL6180x_RangeData_t structure).
 * __Dmax__ is an estimation of the maximum distance (in mm) the product can report a valid distance of a 17% target for 
 * the current ambient light conditions (__Dmax__ decreases when ambient light increases). __Dmax__ should be used only
 * when the product is not able to return a valid distance (no object or object is too far from the ranging sensor).
 * Typically, this is done by checking the __errorStatus__ field of the @a VL6180x_RangeData_t structure returned by 
 * the @a VL6180x_RangePollMeasurement() function.
 * You may refer to ::RangeError_u to get full list of supported error codes.
 * @warning Dmax is estimated for a 17% grey target. If the real target has a reflectance lower than 17%, report Dmax could be over-estimated

/**
 * @def VL6180x_WRAP_AROUND_FILTER_SUPPORT
 * @brief Enable wrap around filter (WAF) feature
 *  
 * In specific conditions, when targeting a mirror or a very reflective metal, a __wrap around__ effect can occur internally to the
 * ranging product which results in returning a wrong distance (under-estimated). Goal of the WAF is to detect this wrap arround effect
 * and to filter it by returning a non-valid distance : __errorStatus__ set to 16 (see ::RangeError_u)
 * @warning Wrap-around filter can not be used when device is running in continuous mode 
 * 
 * @li 0 : Filter is not supported, no filtering code is included in API
 * @li 1 : Filter is supported and active by default
 * @li -1 : Filter is supported but is not active by default @a VL6180x_FilterSetState() can turn it on and off at any time

/**
 * @def VL6180x_EXTENDED_RANGE

 * Correct operation with scaling factor other than 1 (>200mm ) is not granted by ST.
